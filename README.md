# TV Marketing Sales Prediction

Welcome to the TV Marketing Sales Prediction project! ðŸš€ In this project, I've built a simple neural network to predict sales based on TV marketing expenses.

## Overview

The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Loaded the dataset from "tvmarketing.csv" using NumPy and pandas.
   - Normalized the features to ensure effective model training.

2. **Neural Network Implementation:**
   - Created a neural network from scratch, including forward and backward propagation.
   - Trained the model using gradient descent to minimize the cost function.

3. **Results:**
   - Successfully trained the model to predict sales from TV marketing expenses.
   - Visualized the results by plotting original data points and model predictions.

## Code Structure

The code is organized as follows:

- `tvmarketing.csv`: Dataset containing TV marketing expenses and corresponding sales.
- `sales_prediction.py`: Python script with the implementation of the neural network and training process.
- `README.md`: Project documentation providing an overview, usage instructions, and acknowledgments.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

   pip install numpy matplotlib pandas

2. Run the python script

    python sales_prediction.py
